## Goals
- Basics of C syntax & idioms
- Compilation, make files, linkers
- Debugging (active and proactive)
- Defensive coding practices
- Breaking C code
- Writing basic Unix system software

### Rules of this Book
- Type in all the code - do not copy & paste
- Type in code exactly, including comments
- Get it to run and make sure it prints the same output
- if there are bugs, fix them
- do the extra credit
    - skip the oones you can't figure out
- always try before looking for help

## The Core Competencies
#### Reading & Writing
- you need to slow down and be meticulous in your reading of code and writing of code
    - it'll be painful & annoying, but it's a skill you need
#### Attention to Detail
- C demands full attention
    - no 'kind of similar' || 'close enough'
    - assume everything is wrong until proven right
#### Spotting Differences
- spotting differences in C is hard, more 'insignificant looking' characters
- if it doesn't match, it won't run
#### Planning & Debugging
- C requires you to plan what'll you make
- not like other languages where you can 'hack till it works'
    - aka js (heheh)
